COMP309: Machine Learning Tools and Techniques

Assignment One: A+  

The objective of this assignment was to try out a variety of classification and clustering algorithms. It requires use of python, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn, and serves as an introduction to all these tools. Run on python in a jupyter notebook. I scored a total of 97/100 on this assignment earning an A+ grade.  

Assignment Two: A  

The goal of this assignment was to help understanding of data manipulation and visualisation tools for machine learning. The purpose was to implement common data handling methods on real-world observations. To validate the effectiveness of the implemented methods, we were also required to perform data analysis tasks to draw useful conclusions. In particular, the following topics were be reviewed: Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM), Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preparation, Feature Manipulation. I used Orange software to complete this assignment and scored a total of 83/100, earning an A grade.
